### Adding a New Template

**Steps:**

1. **Open `templates.js`**
   - Find the `TEMPLATES` object
   - Add your new template following this structure:

```javascript
  yourTemplateName: {
    name: "Your Template Name",
    render: (data) => {
      const formatDate = (start, end) => {
        // Date formatting logic
      };

      const html = `
        <!-- Your HTML structure -->
        <div class="resume-content your-class">
          <!-- Use data.basics, data.work, data.education, data.skills, data.projects -->
        </div>
      `;

      const css = `
        /* Your CSS styles */
        .resume-content.your-class {
          /* styles */
        }
      `;

      return { html, css };
    },
  },
```

2. **Include all sections:**

## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use template literals for strings with variables
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
const formatDate = (start, end) => {
  if (!end) return formatSingleDate(start);
  return formatDateRange(start, end);
};

// Avoid
const fd = (s, e) => e ? `${s}-${e}` : s;
```

### CSS

- Use meaningful class names
- Group related styles
- Include comments for sections
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout
- Ensure responsive design

**Example:**
```css
/* Good */
.resume-content {
  font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
  padding: 40px;
}

.section-header {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 700;
  margin: 20px 0 10px 0;
}

/* Avoid */
.rc { padding: 40px; } /* unclear abbreviation */
.sh { font-size: 14px; } /* too vague */
```

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Add data attributes where helpful
- Include alt text for images
- Keep structure clean and logical
